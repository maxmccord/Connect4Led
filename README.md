## Running the Controller WebApp

1. Make sure that both [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) are installed.
2. From the `client/` directory, run the command `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies listed in the package file.
3. From the same directory, run the command `node webappserver` to start the server

You should now be able to navigate to `localhost` in your browser to view the controller.
